## Project 1
#### Due Monday, Jan. 30

------------------------------

Program 1
------------------------------
This program is to let you become accustomed to the MARS Simulator.
Write a program that takes 3 values, `a`, `b`, and `c` (defined as variables in the data section with initial values),
then computes `b+(a-c)` and prints out the result.  There should be good text output with the resulting number.

Program 2
------------------------------
Read in two values from the keyboard. Calculate and print out the sum, difference, product and quotient/remainder along
with the original input values. Run it with several test cases. Try a test case where the two operands are 7 digits
each (They can be held as a 32-bit register can hold 2<sup>32</sup> which is approximately 4,000,0000,000). Explain why
you get a strange result.
